## "N-Puzzle" 

solver using IDS, BFS and A*(with using manhattan Huristic) algorithms.
### Usage

Running main_ex1.java looking for a file "input.txt".
The input will be

First line: 1 - for IDS, 2 - for BFS,3 - for A* 

Second line: grid length

Third line: the grid seperated by '-' e.g: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-8

compile and run:
```bash
javac *.java
java java_ex1
```
The output file will be one line contains the operations (U, D ,L, R) as the solution, number of developed nodes and the cost of the solution.

## Prediction Algorithm


### Usage
```bash
python py_ex2.py
```
you need put "train.txt" in same folder you running the program.
