#EX1

"N-Puzzle" solver using IDS, BFS and A*(with using manhattan Huristic) algorithms.

Running main_ex1.java looking for a file "input.txt". The input will be: first line: 1 for IDS, 2 for BFS, 3 for A* second line: grid length third line: the grid seperated by '-' e.g: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-8

The output file will be one line contains the operations (U, D ,L, R) as the solution, number of developed nodes and the cost of the solution.

#EX2

3 prediction algorithms for data sets: KNN, IT3 and Navie Bayse
